# Prototype Design Pattern
To copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. 
It may be needed to not modify the original object while being able to perform 
some operations on clone. 

It can also be used in conjunction with Registries of certain templates. For ex :
Notification / web templates where only few parameters changes and rest of the 
information is used as is from the template.

The Prototype pattern is available in Java out of the box with a Cloneable interface.
